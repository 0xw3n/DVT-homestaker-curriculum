# The ETHStaker-Diva Home Staking Curriculum

## What is this?

This is a knowledge base for Ethereum solo stakers (both vanilla and DVT) designed with non-technical users in mind - serving as the definitive curriculum for aspiring solo stakers.

With a standardised curriculum, organisations will be able to fairly assess the proficiency of new solo stakers across the board using simple quizzes and on/off-chain deliverables when facilitating grants and incentivised test programmes.

This curriculum incorporates both DVT and "vanilla" home staking methods so that new solo stakers are able to launch their first home-based ETH validator with just 1 ETH!

## Who is this for?

Anyone who cares about keeping the Ethereum network decentralised!

1. Liquid staker exploring ways to move away from centralised platforms or large staking pools
2. Aspiring solo staker trying to go from zero to one
3. Existing solo staker or node operations engineer looking to refresh your knowledge
