{% endcontent-ref %}

## Status of uploaded keys

Review the status of your uploaded keys at the end of the **Lido CSM: Upload/Remove/View keys** section.

{% content-ref url="upload-remove-view-validator-keys.md" %}
[upload-remove-view-validator-keys.md](upload-remove-view-validator-keys.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Monitoring for exit requests

The `DASHBOARD` widget of the CSM Web App provides a consolidated view of any exit requests issued to you in the form of `Unbonded` and `Stuck` keys.

As there are no custom alerts available yet, you should check this once every 3 days for now.
