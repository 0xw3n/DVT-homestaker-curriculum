# Lido CSM (WIP)

## How it works

As an overview, the Lido CSM funds valid validator keys uploaded by node operators if the minimum bond required has also been provided.

{% hint style="info" %}
**"Valid validator keys"** in this case refers to validator keystores generated while setting the `withdrawalAddress` field to the Lido CSM contract.
{% endhint %}

### Rewards&#x20;

Solo stakers receive rewards from 2 sources:

1. **The bond provided:** The bond can be provided in ETH, stETH, or wstETH, and they will be converted into stETH, which accrues rewards over time less the 10% staking fee. i.e., `90% * ETH PoS staking yield * total ETH bond provided`
2. **8% share of rewards** of the validator keys funded by the Lido CSM. i.e., 8`% * ETH PoS staking yield * total validator keys funded (32 ETH each)`

### Bond mechanics

#### Providing the CSM bond

The required bond amounts can be provided by anyone, although it will most likely come from the node operator using the CSM (CSM operator) themselves.

#### Bond decrease

The bond provided serves as a deterrence against dishonest behaviours and poor performance by the node operator. e.g.,

1. MEV theft&#x20;
2. Slashing events
3. Sustained poor performance by the node operator causing the effective balance of any validator to fall below 32 ETH

When the events described above are detected, an equivalent amount of node operator's bond will be locked until the stolen/slashed/penalised amounts are made whole. This will cause the net bond balance of the CSM operator to fall below the required threshold.&#x20;

In this scenario, the CSM node operator will cease to accrue rewards on their validator keys funded by Lido CSM until:

* The CSM node operator tops up the shortage
* New rewards generated by the CSM node operator fills up the shortage--e.g., All new rewards will be used to replenish the bond shortage until it is back to the required level

#### Bond increase

On the other hand, because the bond is provided in stETH (which rebases in quantity), the bond balance of CSM operators will increase over time, above the required threshold.

Excess bond balance, together with accrued rewards, will be claimable by CSM operators from the CSM Web App.

### Rewards Address & Manager Address

There are 2 main addresses used by CSM operators.

1. **Rewards Address:** This is the address that all accrued rewards and excess bond amounts will go to when claimed. Rewards Addresses can change Manager Addresses but Rewards Addresses can only be changed by itself.
2. **Manager Address:** This is the address that can trigger the claiming of all accrued rewards and excess bond amounts to the Rewards Address. The Manager Address can also upload/remove new/existing deposit data files. The Manager Address cannot change the Rewards Address.

{% hint style="info" %}
An interesting observation from how the 2 addresses work is that users can technically bifurcate the capital (bond) provider and service provider (node operator) when using the CSM.
{% endhint %}

## Getting started

Recall that running bonded validators via the Lido CSM does not require setting up a separate service on your hardware.

{% content-ref url="../../understanding-eth-validators/bonded-validators.md" %}
[bonded-validators.md](../../understanding-eth-validators/bonded-validators.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Instead, you simply tweak the parameters of the following steps of the native solo staking setup.

### Keystore generation--Withdrawal address

* During the validator key generation step, generate a number of validator keystores (e.g., max 10 per CSM operator) along with the deposit data file while setting the `withdrawalAddress` field to the Lido CSM contract on **Holesky:** [`0xF0179dEC45a37423EAD4FaD5fCb136197872EAd9`](https://holesky.etherscan.io/address/0xF0179dEC45a37423EAD4FaD5fCb136197872EAd9)

{% hint style="info" %}
**DO NOT DEPOSIT 32 ETH** using the deposit data file generated this way as the Lido CSM will make the deposit for you. _**Doing so will result in a loss of funds.**_
{% endhint %}

{% content-ref url="../../keystore-generation-and-mev-boost/validator-key-generation.md" %}
[validator-key-generation.md](../../keystore-generation-and-mev-boost/validator-key-generation.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

You will then upload your `deposit data file` in the [next section](uploading-your-deposit-data-file.md). Make sure you complete the remaining steps on this page before that.&#x20;

### **Validator Client Setup--Fee Recipient Address**

* During the validator client setup step, set the `fee_recipient` flag to the designated fee recipient address for Lido CSM on **Holesky:** [`0xE73a3602b99f1f913e72F8bdcBC235e206794Ac8`](https://holesky.etherscan.io/address/0xE73a3602b99f1f913e72F8bdcBC235e206794Ac8)

{% content-ref url="../../native-solo-staking-setup/validator-client-setup/" %}
[validator-client-setup](../../native-solo-staking-setup/validator-client-setup/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For existing solo stakers, you can spin up a new validator client service specifically for your CSM validator keys so that you can retain your own `fee_recipient` address for your solo staking keys. Refer to [this sub-section](running-a-separate-vc-service.md).
{% endhint %}

### **MEV-Boost Setup--Relay endpoints**

* Remove the `-min-bid` flag (if used)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Ultra Sound and Aestus relays do not censor transactions from OFAC sanctioned addresses.
{% endhint %}

* During the MEV-Boost setup step, set the `-relay` flags only to the list of designated MEV relays for Lido CSM on **Holesky** below.&#x20;
